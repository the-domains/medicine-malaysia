If we do not want the status quo, how do we want health care to be delivered? 

The Commission has identified six attributes of an ideal health care delivery system, each of which has been demonstrated to be an important driver of high performance: 

1\. Patients' clinically relevant information is available to all providers at the point of care and to patients through electronic health record systems. 

2\. Patient care is coordinated among multiple providers, and transitions across care settings are actively managed. 

3\. Providers (including nurses and other members of care teams) both within and across settings have accountability to each other, review each other's work, and collaborate to reliably deliver high-quality, high-value care. x 

4\. Patients have easy access to appropriate care and information, including after hours; there are multiple points of entry to the system; and providers are culturally competent and responsive to patients' needs.  

5\. There is clear accountability for the total care of patients.

6\. The system is continuously innovating and learning in order to improve the quality, value, and patients' experiences of health care delivery
