Martin Skreli is a man we all love to hate. He raised a drug price by 5,556% and jolted everyone including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on drug pricing. 

Drug pricing has always been in the domain of pharmaceutical companies. How they arrived at the prices is clearly not public knowledge. Blaming expensive research to manufacturing cost is the same methodical answer given to pricing a drug high. 

Much of what a patient pays is attributed to the medications that are prescribed. 

So have drug pricing been responsibly done? Is keeping drugs out of reach of most patients due to the astronomical prices of ethical concern?

There is a need for greater transparency in drug pricing. There must be a formula that can be universally and consistently used to reflect the investments made and the intended profits over a certain period of time. Countries where the disposable income is low should enjoy a different pricing strategy to enable much needed innovative medications in reaching patients. 

Gross domestic product (GDP) or the Gross national income (GNI) have been claimed to be the barometer for pricing drugs. If so, it hardly reflects the disposable income of an average citizen of the country. Most GDPs and GNIs are way higher than what the average citizen earns in the country. There must be a better way to judge the affordability and hence influence drug pricing.

Things must change. Otherwise drug prices will be the main driver of a rapidly escalating cost of healthcare. This will cripple even the best of healthcare systems.
