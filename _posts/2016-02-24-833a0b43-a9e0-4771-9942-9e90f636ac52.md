THE ART OF WAR
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92fdc0fb-925a-4be3-b17c-7645dd5eaf85.jpg)

In rheumatology, autoimmunity is a state where the body is at odds with itself. The rebellion of
immune cells, initially entrusted with the defense of the body, is creating havoc, wrecking the
stability and health of the body. Reasons for that rebellion is unclear. The rebels often opt for
guerilla warfare, using stealth techniques to blend in.

Knowing your enemy is paramount to a successful war. Understanding the aetiology and
pathophysiology is crucial but that requires patience and perseverance, as exhaustive
investigative work is done. Often times, a little bit of luck is required to gain the upper hand in
the world of scientific discovery. The discovery of Penicillin is a perfect example.

The weaponry in this war has evolved over the years. Smarter, targeted approach is the
advancement that is hoped can help gain an advantage over the enemy whilst minimising
collateral damage. Whether it is in oncology or rheumatology, such precision would
revolutionise medicine. Achieving that technology may still be a distance away but the work
starts now.

Intelligence is an aspect important in helping to battle the enemy, thus allowing the correct
choice of weapons and selecting the right targets. Bad intelligence can lead to catastrophic
defeat from undesired collateral damage to friendly fire. These are the inevitable mistakes that
must be learned.

The monetary cost of war can be paralysing. It limits the armamentarium at our disposal.
Innovations are only useful if they can be made available where it is needed. Keeping the cost
of medicines high is like starving the troops leaving them to the mercy of the enemy.

Communication and leadership in a war is key in gaining victory. Removing bureaucratic
barriers and consolidating our resources requires a clear direction. Deciphering the clues within
our sight can make the difference between life and death.

So you see, we are at war, a war that we must win if humans are to survive. Come and join the
ranks. There will always be a place for you.
